Hey there! Welcome!


Well, I am an oceanographer that discovered to be passionate about programming (More about this [here](http://leportella.com/english/2016/03/16/from-oceanographer-to-programmer.html)).

I discovered that programming is something that I like and I can learn with a certain amount of easiness. 

While I was working as a developer, I discovered that I could join what I have learned from college and what I have learned as a programmer, and put it all together as a data scientist 
(which was kind of awesome). 

I joined several groups including Pyladies and 2016 national Python conference organizing team (Python Brazil[12]). I love organizing events and teaching beginners that are as passionate as me.

I'm an open-source enthusiast and a living proof of the community's power and of what it can do for a person.
Although I am not originally from computer science, I have a vast experience with data analysis programming scripts (specially with Matlab and Python) and a long 
experience working with multidisciplinary teams (such as biologists, engineers, 
managers, field workers, navy commanders, etc).

I am crazy about books and, in particular, the Chronicles of
Ice and Fire and all their theories. 

I like to write as much as I like to read. So, to help young passionate programmers, I write several blog posts to share things I am learning and my life experiences. 
Most (if not all) of them you can find here.

In 2017, I started a brazilian podcast focusing on data science called [Pizza de Dados](http://podcast.datascience.pizza) or, in english, Data Pizza.
It's been a crazy journey that I never saw coming! But now that's here, I am so happy to do this.
